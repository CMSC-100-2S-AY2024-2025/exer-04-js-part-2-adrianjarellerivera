## Exercise 4: JavaScript Basics II
  
Name: **Adrian Jarelle V. Rivera**

- **Challenges Encountered:** I had to read the documentation on the imported packages since I was not familiar with how they work. The concatenation and importing is similar to python which I enjoyed. However, <code>.addAccount</code> function required so many validations that I am having trouble implementing them all at once.
